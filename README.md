## Notable Features

- I am very pleased with the way I have implemented the star rating feature. I could have quite quickly added a drop down menu with options, but that isn't something that I thought would look particularly nice on the page or be a user friendly experience. I spent some time looking into how other websites present this option (Just Eat, Amazon, etc.) and came up with a plan to create my own version. I'm sure that in places it can be tidied and made more succinct, but as my first attempt at a star rating system I am pleased.
- While the styling is fairly minimal (see below section), I have been able to create a fairly responsive user experience that can handle being used on different devices.

## Unresolved Issues/Un-implemented Features

While I'm happy with the work that I am submitting, there is more that I would have liked to do given more time to work on the project:

- I have tried to implement some basic styling to make the product user friendly and have some level of intuition as to how to use certain features. However, given more time there is more I would have liked to do. For instance, have hidable/collapsable elements.
- The chart proved to be an interesting challenge. I'm happy with how it turned out, but ultimately it took more time than I would have liked and there are small features that I would like to change with some extra time. For instance, the values give options for values with decimal places which can't happen in this use case, so I would like to change the distance between points. I would like to spend a little more time working through the documentation and getting to know how the config is constructed to create more fully featured and controlable charts in the future.

## Prerequistes

## Dependencies/Running

## Notable Features

## Unresolved Issues/Un-implemented Features

While I'm happy with the work that I am submitting, there is more that I would have liked to do given more time to work on the project:

- I have tried to implement some basic styling to make the product user friendly and have some level of intuition as to how to use certain features. However, given more time there is more I would have liked to do. For instance, have hidable/collapsable elements.
